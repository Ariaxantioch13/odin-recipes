    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cookies:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup unsifted powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 Large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fruit jam, divided</li>
      </ul>  
    <h3>Icing:</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.</li>
        <li>Mix together powdered sugar and butter in a large bowl with a rubber spatula until creamy. Add egg yolk, vanilla, salt, and almond extract; mix well. Blend in flour until just combined.</li>
        <li>Use a sorbet scoop to portion dough into 1/2-ounce (about 1 tablespoon) balls. Roll each ball in a plate of white sugar to coat; roll again between your palms. Place several inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten balls lightly with your fingers.</li>
        <li>For jammier cookies, skip to Step 7. For shortbread-type cookies, poke a well into each ball using a finger or the end of a thick wooden spoon dusted with powdered sugar. Fill wells with fruit jam. Tap the baking sheet against the counter to let jam settle.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are barely blonde and bottoms are slightly golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack before icing.</li>
        <li>Make icing: Place powdered sugar in a small bowl. Add milk, a little at a time, until icing reaches a consistency that will hold its shape when piped. Pipe over cookies in a zigzag pattern. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Press thumb into each ball to make a large, shallow indentation. Spoon in jam. Tap the baking sheet against the counter to let jam settle.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cookies rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Enjoy with a glass of cold milk!</li>
      </ol>
